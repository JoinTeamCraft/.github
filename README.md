# TeamCraft

**TeamCraft** is a digital hackathon and work-simulation platform designed for **modern hiring**.  
We help companies evaluate real engineering skills through **hands-on challenges, collaborative problem-solving, and production-like environments**, not resumes or trivia tests.

Our focus is simple.  
**See candidates work. Hire with confidence.**

## What TeamCraft Does

TeamCraft enables organizations to run **structured, job-relevant digital hackathons** that simulate real work.

- **Work-Simulation Hiring**
  Candidates solve realistic problems using the same tools, constraints, and collaboration patterns used on the job.

- **Digital Hackathons at Scale**
  Run hiring hackathons for roles, teams, or cohorts. Fully remote, time-bound, and measurable.

- **Skill-Based Evaluation**
  Assess problem-solving, system design, collaboration, and execution. Not memorization.

- **Signal Over Noise**
  Replace resume bias and generic tests with observable engineering behavior.

- **Team-Centric Hiring**
  Evaluate how candidates communicate, review code, and ship together.

## Why TeamCraft

Traditional hiring is broken.
- Resumes are noisy.
- Interviews are inconsistent.
- Take-home tests don’t reflect real work.
- Whiteboard questions reward memorization.

TeamCraft fixes this by turning hiring into **a controlled, fair, real-world simulation**.

If a candidate can perform in TeamCraft, they can perform on your team.
